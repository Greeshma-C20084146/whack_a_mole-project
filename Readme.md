# Technologies Used üõ†
HTML: The whack-a-Mole game can be played online using HTML, which improves the entire gameplay experience.

CSS: Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the whack-a-mole game can¬†be styled and made more appealing graphically. It is in charge of deciding how the game will look, including how game objects like moles, backgrounds, and buttons will be made. The game will be more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly for players as a result of CSS's responsive design, which makes sure that it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.

JavaScript: It is the foundation of the whack-a-mole game, offering functionality and interactivity.

# Reflection
In a 1.5-month game development project following the Scrum methodology, our journey began with a crucial step: the prioritization of game features and tasks. Assembling a tight-knit Scrum team, inclusive of all team members, was our next move. This cross-functional team was carefully constructed to tackle the challenges ahead. 

We divided our project into short one or two-week work periods, which is a key part of our project management method. In these periods, we carefully looked at our to-do list and focused on the most important tasks. Every day, we had quick meetings where the team talked about what they were doing and if they had any problems. At the end of each work period, we were excited to show what we had done in a meeting. We often had a version of the game that people could play. After that, we had another meeting to talk about what went well and how we could do better in the next work period.

Our whack-a-mole game, at its core, is a harmonious fusion of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used HTML for the basic structure of our online game, and we added .svg images to make it look better. These images were neatly organized in our project folder. CSS helped us make the game look good and work on different devices. JavaScript was essential for making the game interactive. However, we faced challenges in making the game the right level of difficulty, designing attractive graphics, creating an easy-to-use interface, and ensuring the game runs smoothly. In the end, what made our game successful was its simple gameplay, gradual difficulty, and the ability to listen to player feedback and improve.

Instead of a fixed time limit, we thought of introducing a random game mechanic. For example, the game could end when the player misses a certain number of moles in a row. We thought of proposing this idea for future purposes to make our game more attractive. We also wanted to add multiple levels, such as easy, medium, and hard, to our game, which was quite challenging for us. Also, simplicity was key to maintaining our game's allure. Rigorous testing across a variety of devices was crucial for our gameplay. We also discovered the importance of responsiveness to user feedback while making this game. Nonetheless, we encountered some setbacks in our Whack-a-mole game when we tried to add some bomb functions to our code so that users could whack them instead of these regular moles. However, we faced some issues in our code because time and moles were randomly generated, which led to some issues. Still, Our whack-a-mole journey was filled with creative challenges, triumphant victories, and lessons that will continue to guide us in the world of game development.

In conclusion, the development process for our game project was filled with challenges that proved to be invaluable learning opportunities. Overcoming these obstacles required persistence, creativity, and collaboration. In doing so, we gained skills and knowledge that will no doubt aid us in future projects. Though the road was difficult at times, our team persevered and is extremely proud to have this completed game to show for the effort. The final product represents the culmination of our vision, hard work, teamwork and commitment to delivering an entertaining and immersive gaming experience to players. We are thrilled to now share it with others and hope they find it as fun and rewarding to play as we found it to create.
