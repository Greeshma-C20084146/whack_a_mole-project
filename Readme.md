JavaScript: It is the foundation of the whack-a-mole game, offering functionality and interactivity.

# Reflection
In a 1.5-month game development project following the Scrum methodology, our journey began with a crucial step: the prioritization of game features and tasks. Assembling a tight-knit Scrum team, inclusive of all team members, was our next move. This cross-functional team was carefully constructed to tackle the challenges ahead. 

We wisely structured our project into manageable one or two-week Sprints, a cornerstone of the Scrum framework. During our Sprint Planning sessions, we meticulously sifted through the product backlog, focusing our efforts on high-priority items. Daily standup meetings became an integral part of our daily routine, ensuring our team remained in sync. These meetings served as a platform for our team members to not only share their daily tasks but also discuss any impediments they encountered. As each Sprint came to a close, we eagerly anticipated the Sprint Review, a moment to unveil our progress. It was an opportunity to showcase our accomplishments, often including a playable game version. Following the Sprint Review, we transitioned into the Sprint Retrospective, a session dedicated to gathering feedback and refining our processes for the upcoming Sprint. Our whack-a-mole game, at its core, is a harmonious fusion of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML, residing primarily within the index.html file, provided the structural foundation for our online gameplay. Additionally, we seamlessly integrated.svg images into our project, enhancing the game's visuals. 

These visual assets were thoughtfully organized within our project folder for quick and efficient access. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, played a pivotal role in sculpting our game's aesthetics. It bestowed us with the power to style various elements, making the game not only visually appealing but also adaptable to diverse screens. From the cheeky moles to the vibrant backgrounds and interactive buttons, CSS was our artistic brush. Its responsive design capabilities ensured that our game gracefully adjusted to different screen sizes and devices, ultimately enhancing the user experience. Javascript emerged as the linchpin of our whack-a-mole game. Within its code, an intricate web of functions worked in harmony, overseeing various aspects of the game, from mechanics to user interactions. It breathed life into our game, propelling it into the realm of interactivity. But, as with any journey, challenges presented themselves. Balancing the game's difficulty was a delicate task, demanding precision to keep players engaged. Designing captivating graphics became a creative endeavour, as we strived to capture the player's imagination. Crafting an intuitive user interface, optimizing performance, and integrating fitting audio elements introduced layers of complexity to our project. In the end, our game's success hinged on several key elements. 

Simplicity was key to maintaining our game's allure. Rigorous testing across a variety of devices was crucial for our gameplay. We also discovered the importance of responsiveness to user feedback while making this game. Nonetheless, we encountered some setbacks in our Whack-a-mole game when we tried to add some bomb functions to our code so that users could whack them instead of these regular moles. However, we faced some issues because in our code because time and moles were randomly generated which led to some issues. Still, Our whack-a-mole journey was filled with creative challenges, triumphant victories, and lessons that will continue to guide us in the world of game development.
